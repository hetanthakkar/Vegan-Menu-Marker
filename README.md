# ðŸŒ± Vegan Menu Marker

A Chrome extension that automatically marks vegan dishes on Google Maps restaurant menus with a ðŸŒ± emoji.

- **Smart Recognition**: Identifies vegan substitutes like "vegan cheese", "jackfruit", "Beyond Meat"
- **Toggle Control**: Easy on/off switch in the popup

*This extension errs on the side of caution - when in doubt, it won't mark an item as vegan. Always verify ingredients for strict dietary requirements.*
